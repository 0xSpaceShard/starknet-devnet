# L1-L2 interaction via Postman

Postman is a Starknet utility that allows testing L1-L2 interaction. It is **unrelated** to the [Postman API platform](https://www.postman.com/). Ensure you have an L1 node and a Devnet (L2 node) running, [load](#load) a messaging contract, and [flush](#flush) the queue to transmit the messages to their destinations. The functionality relies on two internal message queues: one for L1->L2 messages, another for L2->L1 messages.

You can use [**`starknet-devnet-js`**](https://github.com/0xSpaceShard/starknet-devnet-js) to perform these actions, as witnessed in [**this example**](https://github.com/0xSpaceShard/starknet-devnet-js/blob/master/test/l1-l2-postman.test.ts), or directly send requests to the endpoints specified below.

## Load

```
POST /postman/load_l1_messaging_contract
```

```json
{
  "network_url": "http://localhost:8545",
  "address": "0x123...def"
}
```

```
JSON-RPC
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "1",
    "method": "devnet_postmanLoad",
    "params": {
      "network_url": "http://localhost:8545",
      "address": "0x123...def"
    }
}
```

Loads a `MockStarknetMessaging` contract. The `address` parameter is optional; if provided, the `MockStarknetMessaging` contract will be fetched from that address, otherwise a new one will be deployed.

`network_url` is the URL of the JSON-RPC API of the L1 node you've run locally or that already exists; possibilities include, and are not limited to:

- [**Anvil**](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/crates/anvil)
- [**Sepolia testnet**](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/)
- [**Ganache**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ganache)
- [**Geth**](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum#docker-quick-start)
- [**Hardhat node**](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/#running-stand-alone-in-order-to-support-wallets-and-other-software)

:::info Dumping and Loading

Loading a messaging contract is a dumpable event, meaning that, if you've enabled dumping, a messaging-contract-loading event will be dumped. Keep in mind that, if you rely on Devnet deploying a new contract, i.e. if you don't specify a contract address of an already deployed messaging contract, a new contract will be deployed at a new address on each loading of the dump. Read more about dumping [here](./dump-load-restart#dumping).

## Flush

```
POST /postman/flush
```

```
JSON-RPC
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "1",
    "method": "devnet_postmanFlush"
}
```

Goes through the newly enqueued messages since the last flush, consuming and sending them from L1 to L2 and from L2 to L1. Use it for end-to-end testing. Requires no body. Optionally, set the `dry_run` boolean flag to just see the result of flushing, without actually triggering it:

```
POST /postman/flush
```

```js
{ "dry_run": true }
```

```
JSON-RPC
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "1",
    "method": "devnet_postmanFlush",
    "params": {
      "dry_run": true
    }
}
```

A running L1 node is required if `dry_run` is not set.

:::info Dumping and Loading

Flushing is not dumpable, meaning that, if you've enabled dumping, a flushing event will not itself be re-executed on loading. This is because it produces L2 messaging events that are themselves dumped. No L1-side actions are dumped, you need to take care of those yourself. Read more about dumping [here](./dump-load-restart#dumping).

## Disclaimer

This method of L1-L2 communication testing differs from how Starknet mainnet and testnets work. Taking [**L1L2Example.sol**](https://github.com/MikeSpa/starknet-test/blob/6a68d033cd7ddb5df937154f860f1c06174e6860/L1L2Example.sol#L46) (originally from Starknet documentation, no longer available there):

```solidity
constructor(IStarknetCore starknetCore_) public {
    starknetCore = starknetCore_;
}
```

The constructor takes an `IStarknetCore` contract as argument, however for Devnet's L1-L2 communication testing, this has to be replaced with the logic in [**MockStarknetMessaging.sol**](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/master/src/starkware/starknet/testing/MockStarknetMessaging.sol):

```solidity
constructor(MockStarknetMessaging mockStarknetMessaging_) public {
    starknetCore = mockStarknetMessaging_;
}
```

## Mock transactions

### L1->L2

:::note

A running L1 node is **not** required for this operation.

:::

Sends a mock transactions to L2, as if coming from L1, without the need for running L1. The deployed L2 contract address `l2_contract_address` and `entry_point_selector` must be valid, otherwise a new block will not be created. The `l1_transaction_hash` property is optional and, if provided, enables future `starknet_getMessagesStatus` requests with that hash value provided.

Normally `nonce` is calculated by the L1 Starknet contract and it is used in L1 and L2. In this case, it needs to be provided manually.

```
POST /postman/send_message_to_l2
```

Request:

```js
{
    "l2_contract_address": "0x00285ddb7e5c777b310d806b9b2a0f7c7ba0a41f12b420219209d97a3b7f25b2",

```

### L2->L1

Sends a mock transaction from L2 to L1. The deployed L2 contract address `from_address` and `to_address` must be valid.

It is a mock message, but only in the sense that you are mocking an L2 contract's action, which would normally be triggered by invoking the contract via a transaction. So keep in mind the following:

:::note

A running L1 node is required for this operation.
