# Forking

To interact with contracts deployed on mainnet or testnet, you can use forking. Simulate the origin and experiment with it locally, making no changes to the origin itself.

```
$ starknet-devnet --fork-network <URL> [--fork-block <BLOCK_NUMBER>]
```

The value passed to `--fork-network` should be the URL to a Starknet JSON-RPC API provider. Specifying a `--fork-block` is optional; it defaults to the `"latest"` block at the time of Devnet's start-up. All calls will first try Devnet's state and then fall back to the forking block.

:::note How it works

When you send a request to a forked Devnet instance, it first queries Devnet's local state, then tries the forking origin. Forking is not a step simply performed on Devnet startup, but happens continuously while the Devnet instance is alive.

:::

## Forking and ACCEPTED_ON_L1

Assume you have run Devnet as a fork from an origin at a block that is not yet `ACCEPTED_ON_L1`, but only `ACCEPTED_ON_L2`. If in your state queries you specify `block_id: "l1_accepted"`, and there are no local blocks marked as `ACCEPTED_ON_L1`, Devnet will assume the forking block has become `ACCEPTED_ON_L1`.

Read more about marking blocks as `ACCEPTED_ON_L1` on Devnet: [link](./blocks#accepting-blocks-on-l1).

## Account impersonation

[Here](./account-impersonation) you can read more about acting as an account deployed on the origin.

## Deploying an undeclared account

[Here](./predeployed#deploying-an-undeclared-account) you can read about deploying an account not declared on Devnet.

## Checking forking status

To see if your Devnet instance is using forking or not, [fetch the current configuration](./api#config-api), and check the `url` property of its `fork_config` property. If Devnet is forked, this property contains the string of the origin URL specified on startup.
