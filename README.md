# starknet-devnet-rs

A local testnet for Starknet... in Rust

This repository is work in progress, please be patient. As of Starknet 0.12.2, [Pythonic Devnet](https://github.com/0xSpaceShard/starknet-devnet) is still the way to go.

## Requirements

It is required to install the latest version of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Run

After git-cloning this repository, install and run the project with:

```
$ cargo run
```

## Run with Docker

This application is available as a Docker image (architectures: arm64 and amd64). To download the `latest` image, run:

```text
$ docker pull shardlabs/starknet-devnet-rs
```

To properly run a container, check out the [next paragraph](#container-port-publishing).

Commits to the `main` branch of this repository are mostly available as images tagged with their commit hash (the full 40-lowercase-hex-digits SHA1 digest):

```
$ docker pull shardlabs/starknet-devnet-rs:<COMMIT_HASH>
```

By appending the `-seed0` suffix, you can use images which [predeploy funded accounts](#predeployed-accounts) with `--seed 0`, thus always predeploying the same set of accounts. E.g.:

```
$ docker pull shardlabs/starknet-devnet-rs:<VERSION>-seed0
$ docker pull shardlabs/starknet-devnet-rs:latest-seed0
```

### Container port publishing

#### Linux

If on a Linux host machine, you can use [`--network host`](https://docs.docker.com/network/host/). This way, the port used internally by the container is also available on your host machine. The `--port` option can be used (as well as other CLI options).

```text
$ docker run --network host shardlabs/starknet-devnet-rs [--port <PORT>]
```

#### Mac, Windows

If not on Linux, you need to publish the container's internally used port to a desired `<PORT>` on your host machine. The internal port is `5050` by default (probably not your concern, but can be overridden with `--port`).

```text
$ docker run -p [HOST:]<PORT>:5050 shardlabs/starknet-devnet-rs
```

E.g. if you want to use your host machine's `127.0.0.1:5050`, you need to run:

```text
$ docker run -p 127.0.0.1:5050:5050 shardlabs/starknet-devnet-rs
```

You may ignore any address-related output logged on container startup (e.g. `Starknet Devnet listening on 0.0.0.0:5050`). What you will use is what you specified with the `-p` argument.

If you don't specify the `HOST` part, the server will indeed be available on all of your host machine's addresses (localhost, local network IP, etc.), which may present a security issue if you don't want anyone from the local network to access your Devnet instance.

## CLI options

Check out the CLI options with one of:

```
cargo run -- -h
cargo run -- --help
```

## Logging

By default, the logging level is INFO, but this can be changed via the `RUST_LOG` environment variable.

All logging levels: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`

To specify the logging level and run Devnet on the same line, you can do:

```
RUST_LOG=<LEVEL> cargo run
```

## Mint token

For now, you can consult the [Pythonic Devnet docs on minting](https://0xspaceshard.github.io/starknet-devnet/docs/guide/mint-token/), with the difference of lite minting not being supported anymore.

## Development - Visual Studio Code

It is highly recommended to get familiar with [Visual Studio Code Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/create-dev-container#_dockerfile) and install [rust-analyzer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust) extension.

## Development - Linter

Run the linter with:

```
./scripts/clippy_check.sh
```

## Development - Formatter

Run the formatter with:

```
./scripts/format.sh
```

If you encounter an error like

```
error: toolchain 'nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu' is not installed
```

Resolve it with:

```
rustup default nightly
```

## Development - Testing

Run all tests with:

```
cargo test
```

To ensure that integration tests pass, be sure to have run `cargo build --release` or `cargo run --release` prior to that (this will build the production target that is used in these tests, so spawning Background Devnet won't time out)
