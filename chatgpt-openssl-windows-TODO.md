This error indicates that the Rust crate `openssl-sys` is trying to build OpenSSL from source during the build process, but it fails‚Äîspecifically, `perl` exits with code 2. This is common on **Windows in CI environments** when some dependencies are missing.

### üîç Root Cause:

- `openssl-sys` depends on `openssl-src` to build OpenSSL from source.
- On Windows, this build process needs:

  - A **Perl interpreter** (usually Strawberry Perl).
  - A C compiler and build tools (MSVC).
  - Sometimes NASM (for assembly).

- These aren't typically available in CircleCI's default Windows images.

### ‚úÖ Recommended Fixes

You have **two main options**:

---

### **Option 1: Use System OpenSSL Instead of Building from Source**

If you don‚Äôt need to build OpenSSL from source, you can use a pre-installed OpenSSL and set environment variables to point to it:

1. **Install OpenSSL** in your CircleCI image (or ensure it exists).
2. Set these environment variables in your build config:

   ```yaml
   environment:
     OPENSSL_DIR: "C:\\OpenSSL-Win64"
     OPENSSL_STATIC: "1"
   ```

   Adjust the path depending on where OpenSSL is installed.

You can download OpenSSL precompiled binaries from [https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html).

### **Option 2: Make the Build Environment Capable of Compiling OpenSSL**

Install all required build tools in your CircleCI Windows environment:

1. **Install Perl:**
   Use [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/), e.g.:

   ```powershell
   choco install strawberryperl
   ```

2. **Install NASM** (for assembly routines used in OpenSSL):

   ```powershell
   choco install nasm
   ```

3. Ensure you‚Äôre using a proper **MSVC toolchain** with `build-essential` or `Visual Studio Build Tools`.

4. Set these env vars if needed:

   ```yaml
   environment:
     OPENSSL_NO_VENDOR: "1" # optional - disables openssl-src
   ```

### üõ†Ô∏è CircleCI Config Example (Windows Executor)

```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    machine:
      image: windows-server-2019-vs2019:stable
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install dependencies
          shell: powershell.exe
          command: |
            choco install -y rustup strawberryperl nasm
            rustup install stable
            rustup default stable
      - run:
          name: Build project
          shell: powershell.exe
          command: cargo build --release
```

### ‚úÖ Final Advice

If you can avoid building OpenSSL from source (Option 1), that‚Äôs usually faster and more reliable. But if your project demands it (e.g. for specific OpenSSL versions), then Option 2 is the right path.
